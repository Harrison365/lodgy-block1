# createRangeArr

- create a function, **createRangeArr**, that takes an array of two values and returns a new array containing the range between those two values.

- your solution to this function should be solved recursively.

- you do not need to worry about sorting in this version of the kata as the start number will always be less than the end number in the tests, unless they are equal in value.
